## ETL <a name="etl"></a>
We gathered this data from Kaggle and transformed it using Python Pandas.<br />

We added a new column to contained binned aged we planned on using. <br />

## Mechine learning <a name="machine-learning"></a>
We created three supervised mechine learning models:

### Model 1 <a name="model-1"></a>

### Model 2 <a name="model-2"></a>

### Model 3

We we able to get a final best accuracy of **0.9643**

## Analysis
Lastly, we used Tableau to analysize and visualize our findings.<br />

## Key Findings Based on our Dataset
**Males are more likely to develop diabetes.<br />

Females with hypertension have a 97% chance of developing diabetes in their lifetime.<br />

Overall, individuals with diabetes are twice as likely to have hypertension. <br />

Current AND former smokers are more likely to develop diabetes. <br />

Seniors (61+) are the most vulnerable group with 22.23% of seniors having diabetes.**<br />
